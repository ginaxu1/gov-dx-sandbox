  description: |
    Handles consent creation, approval, and management for the OpenDIF Data Exchange Platform. 
    It uses a hybrid security model:
    - **User-facing endpoints** (GET/PUT /consents/{id}) are protected by User JWTs from an identity provider for consent-portal access.
    - **Internal endpoints** (POST /consents, PATCH/DELETE /consents/{id}) require no authentication for service-to-service communication.
