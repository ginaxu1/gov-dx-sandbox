package models

// types.go contains generic/reusable types that may be used across multiple models.
// Examples include:
// - Custom hashmap types (e.g., map[string]interface{} with custom JSON marshaling)
// - Custom scanner/valuer types for database operations
// - Generic utility types that don't belong to a specific domain
//
// Domain-specific types should be placed in their respective files (e.g., consent.go)
